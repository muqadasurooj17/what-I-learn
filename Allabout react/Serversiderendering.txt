We import the express, React, and ReactDOMServer modules.

We create an Express application.

We define a simple React component called HelloWorld that we want to render on the server.

We set up an Express route at the root URL ('/') to render the HelloWorld component using ReactDOMServer.renderToString.

We send the HTML containing the rendered component as the response to the client.
This example demonstrates a basic server-side rendering setup with React and Express. 
The ReactDOMServer.renderToString function is used to render the React component on the server and send 
it as part of the server's response. In a real-world scenario, you would typically render more complex 
components and fetch data from APIs to provide dynamic content.
